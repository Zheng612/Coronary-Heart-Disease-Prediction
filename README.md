The ‘framingham’ dataset provides information whether the participants developed Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) after ten years of the study. The objective of the project is to determine the risk factors for predicting the probability of developing CHD. 

I used classification techniques such as decision tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors that predicts diagnose results based on 6 important features (gender, age, cigsPerDay, prevalentStroke, sysBP, glucose). Confusion matrix was later on used to evaluate the model for each predictive modeling process.
